<h2 id="mcetoc_1g236t80ouq"><strong>Crop resilience for climate change</strong></h2>
<p>As a research assistant at the USDA-ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center, I conducted potassium limitation crop stress experiments for use in Africa (funded by USAID). I designed, implemented, and validated new methodology for determining leaf area. I collected plant biomass and analyzed nutrient composition with nitrate reduction. I trained and mentored three undergraduate researchers in analytical and experimental methods.</p>
